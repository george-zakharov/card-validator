# Credit Card Validator #
Based on [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).

Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discoverer) and validates it to make sure that it is a valid number (look into how credit cards use a checksum).
